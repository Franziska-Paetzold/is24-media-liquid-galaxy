# Draft: Project Liquid Galaxy for Real Estate Search

The idea is to build a "[Liquid Galaxy](https://liquidgalaxy.endpoint.com/)" installation similiar to the ones which one can find in pretty much every Google office lobby.
Ideally the installation shall be reasonably portable so that we can take it occasionally to conferences or events.

What is liquid galaxy? Well, this is how it looks like:

And here is the marketing text for their real estate use case:

_The Liquid Galaxy provides an excellent tool for real estate brokerages and land use agencies to showcase their properties with multiple large screens showing 3D building models and complete Google Earth data. End Point can configure the Liquid Galaxy to highlight specific buildings, areas on the map, or any set of correlated land use data, which can then be shown in a dazzling display that forms the centerpiece of a conference room or lobby. We can program the Liquid Galaxy to show floor plans, panoramic interior photos, and even Google Street View “walking tours” around a given property._

_A Liquid Galaxy in your office will provide your firm with a sophisticated and cutting edge sales tool. You will depart from the traditional ways of viewing, presenting, and even managing real estate sites by introducing your clients to multiple prime locations and properties in a wholly unique, professional, and visually stunning manner. We can even highlight amenities such as mass transit, road usage, and basic demographic data for proper context._

_The Liquid Galaxy allows your clients an in-depth contextual tour of multiple listings in the comfort of your office without having to travel to multiple locations. Liquid Galaxy brings properties to the client instead of taking the client to every property. This saves time and energy for both you and your prospective clients, and sets your brokerage apart as a technology leader in the market._
